Welcome to our tutorial on TCP!

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, and it's a protocol used for reliable and ordered delivery of data between two devices on a network.

TCP works by establishing a connection between two devices, also known as a TCP handshake. During the handshake, the devices exchange information about how they will communicate, such as the initial sequence numbers and the maximum amount of data they can send.

Once the connection is established, the devices can start exchanging data using TCP segments. Each TCP segment contains a sequence number, which allows the receiver to ensure that the segments are received in the correct order and without any missing data.

TCP also includes mechanisms for flow control and congestion control, which help to ensure that the network is not overwhelmed with too much data at once.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the following topics:

1. TCP handshake: We'll explain how the TCP handshake works and the information that's exchanged during the handshake.

2. TCP segments: We'll discuss how TCP segments are used to transmit data and how they ensure reliable and ordered delivery.

3. Flow control: We'll explain how TCP implements flow control to prevent data loss and improve performance.

4. Congestion control: We'll discuss how TCP implements congestion control to prevent network congestion and improve performance.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of TCP and how it's used to transmit data between devices on a network. Let's get started!
